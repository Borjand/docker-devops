    <p><em>Congratulations! You have successfully completed Milestone 2</em></p>
    <p>
      <br>During this excercise, we have successfully developed a web application comprising two crucial processes:
       a web browser and a web server, both functioning as application processes. As discussed in class, HTTP operates
       through a dual-program structure, involving a client-side program and a server-side program. In our specific case:
      <p></p>
      <br>- The web browser is executed on the PCA by means of Lynx, adeptly fulfilling the role of the
       client-side functionality of HTTP.
      <p></p>
      <br>- Conversely, the web server executed on PCB with Apache
       seamlessly takes charge of executing the server-side operations of the HTTP protocol.
      <p></p>
      This configuration allowed us to visualize the content of the web index page,
       and to review the concepts of web applications discussed in class, such as the TCP three-way handshake,
       the HTTP GET request, and the HTTP 200 OK response.
